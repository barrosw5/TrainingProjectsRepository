# 🧠 Training Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Training Projects Repository** — a collection of hands-on exercises, experiments, and learning projects created to explore and strengthen my skills in software development.  
Each folder represents a different topic or mini-project I’ve worked on, featuring technologies such as **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **JPA**.

### 🔸 About the `.vscode` Folder
The `.vscode` folder is **not required** to run any of the projects.  
It simply stores local settings for **Visual Studio Code**, such as build configuration prompts and null analysis options.  
You can safely delete it if you use another IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse) or prefer to keep your repo clean.
