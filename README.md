# 🧠 Spring Boot Test Project

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Test** project — a hands-on exercise created to explore and strengthen my skills in backend development.

This project is a functional application designed to experiment with **Spring Boot** mechanics, database integration via **PostgreSQL**, and data persistence using **JPA**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application focuses on the following core concepts:

- **REST API Development:** Building endpoints to handle HTTP requests.
- **Database Integration:** Connecting to a PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Persistence:** Using JPA (Hibernate) for Object-Relational Mapping.
- **Dependency Management:** Utilizing Maven for build automation.

### 🔸 About the `.vscode` Folder
The `.vscode` folder included in this project is **not required** to run the application.  
It simply stores local settings for **Visual Studio Code**, such as build configuration prompts and null analysis options.  
You can safely delete it if you use another IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse) or prefer to keep your repo clean.
